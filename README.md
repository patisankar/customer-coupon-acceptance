# customer-coupon-acceptance
UCI Machine Learning Repository contains survey responses collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk. It presents various driving scenarios and asks participants whether they would accept a coupon. The target variable indicates coupon acceptance (Y = 1 for "Right away" or "Later", and Y = 0 for "No"). Coupons are offered for five types of venues: less expensive restaurants, coffee houses, carryout/takeaway, bars, and more expensive restaurants.
